## **Passby Value and Passby Reference**

In Python, the following data structures are passed by value:

1. Immutable types (passed by value):
   - Numbers (integers, floats, etc.)
   - Strings
   - Tuples

When an immutable type is passed as an argument to a function or assigned to another variable, a copy of the value is made, and any modifications made to the copy will not affect the original value.

Example:
```python
def modify_string(s):
    s += " World"

my_string = "Hello"
modify_string(my_string)
print(my_string)  # Output: Hello
```

2. Mutable types (passed by reference):
   - Lists
   - Dictionaries
   - Sets

When a mutable type is passed as an argument to a function or assigned to another variable, a reference to the original object is passed, not a copy. Any modifications made to the object will affect the original value.

Example:
```python
def modify_list(lst):
    lst.append(4)

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
modify_list(my_list)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

It's important to note that although mutable types are passed by reference, reassigning the entire variable within the function will create a new local reference that doesn't affect the original value.

Example:
```python
def modify_list(lst):
    lst = [4, 5, 6]  # Reassigning the variable

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
modify_list(my_list)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

In this case, the `lst` variable within the function is a local reference to a new list `[4, 5, 6]`, but it doesn't affect the original list `my_list` outside the function.
