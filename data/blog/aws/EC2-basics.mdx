## **What is Amazon EC2?**

EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS' offering. It is definitely used everywhere. And what is it? Well, it stands for **Elastic Compute Cloud** and this is the way to do Infrastructure as a Service on AWS. So EC2 is not just one service. It's composed of many things at a high level.
- You can rent virtual machines on EC2, they're called EC2 instances. 
- You can store data on virtual drives or EBS volumes. 
- You can distribute load across machines, Elastic Load Balancer. 
- You can scale services using an auto-scaling group or AS

## **EC2 sizing & configuration options**

- Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows, Mac OS 
- How much compute power and cores you want (CPU) 
- How much random access memory or RAM you want
- How much storage space,
    - Network-attached (EBS or EFS)
    - Hardware-attached (EC2 instance store)
- Network card
- Firewall rules: Security group
- Bootstrap script (configure the instance at first launch): EC2 User Data

## **EC2 User Data**

It is possible to bootstrap our instances using the EC2 User Data script. So what does bootstrapping mean? Well, bootstrapping means launching commands when the machine starts. So, that script is only run once and when it first starts, and then will never be run again. So the EC2 User Data has a very specific purpose. It is to automate boot tasks, hence the name bootstrapping. So what tasks do you want to automate? 

EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
- Install updates
- Install software
- Download common files from the Internet

So it could be whatever you want, but just know that the more you add into your User Data script, the more your instant has to do at boot time. Simple. EC2 User Data scripts runs with a root user. 

 ## **What type of instances do we get for EC2?** 
 
![EC2 Instance Example](/static/images/blogs/AWS/EC2-instance-examples.webp)


This is an example. There are hundreds and hundreds of EC2 instance types, but, here are five for you. So the first one is a t2 micro, very very simple. It has one vCPU, one gigabyte of memory. The storage is only for EBS, and it has a low to moderate network performance. But as soon as you increase the instance type like for example if you stay in the same family, so we stay in the t2 family but we go to t2.xlarge, now we have access to four vCPU 16 megabytes of RAM, gigabytes of RAM, sorry, and network performance of moderate. If we go to complete different new levels, so c5d.4xlarge, which is a very complicated name, you get 16 vCPU, so 16 cores, you get 32 gigabytes of memory, so a lot more, you get some storage that is attached to your EC2 instance, this is where it says 400 NVMe SSD. Now the network is going to get really good up to 10 gigabytes, as well as the bandwidth to talk to network storage. And so, as you can see, if you go to r5.16xlarge or m5.8xlarge, again you have different characteristics.

Okay, so now let's talk about EC2 Instance Types. So there are different types of EC2 instances that you can use for different use cases and they have different types of optimization. And let's go check out this link and we'll see we have for now, seven different types of EC2 instances. So this website on the AWS website is what we're interested into. And as we can see, we have different types of instances. We have general purpose, compute, optimized, memory optimize and so on. And so for each type of instance we have different families. And so as we can see this website is going to be the reference for us to look at Institute Instance types and know their costs and other specificity. What I'm going to do though, is just walk you through a high-level overview of how they work in AWS. AWS will have the following naming convention. For example, we'll be talking about an M five dot two X large type of instance. What does that mean? Well, M is going to be called the Instance Class. Okay. And this is going to be, for example, in this case a general purpose type of instance, five is generation of the instance. So as AWS improves the hardware over time if we release a new generation of hardware, and so after M five, if they improve the M type of instance class then we'll go to M six and then finally the two X large represented the size within the instance class. So, it starts as small and then large and then two X large four X large and so on. So it represents the size of the instance, and the more the size, the more the memory the more the CPU is going to have on your instance. So from an exam perspective, what do you need to know? Well, we'll talk about a few different types of instance types. So you have a general purpose and these are great for diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories. They will have a good balance between compute, memory, networking. And so in this course we'll be using general purpose instances. We'll be using the T2 micro which is the free tier, general purpose type of instance. On the website that I just showed you you will see all the different types of instance that our general purpose and this is going to evolve over time, So I won't update this slide. But you can always refer back to the AWS website to check what the instances are in the general purpose type of family. Then we have compute optimized, and these are instances are great, and optimized for compute intensive tasks. So what requires a high level of processor? Well, if, for example, it could be if you're batch processing some data if you're doing media transcoding if you need a high-performance web servers if you're doing high performance, computing is called HPC. If you're doing machine learning or if you have a dedicated gaming server. So all these things are tasks that require a very good CPU very good compute side. And so Ec2, instances do have this kind of particularity and for now all the computer optimized instances in EC2, are of the C names. So C5, C6, and so on. Next, we have some EC2 instances that are memory optimized and there are going to be have a really fast performance for the type of workloads that will process large datasets in memory. So memory means RAM. And so the use cases are this is going to be high performance for relational or non-relational databases are mostly going to be in memory databases, distributed web-scale cache store. So for our elastic cache, for example in memory databases that are optimized for business intelligence or BI. And applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data. So in terms of the names for the memory optimized instances there's going to be the R series because R stands for RAM but there's also going to be X one high memory and Z one, but again, you don't have to remember the name of the instances, but good to know at a high level. Okay. And finally we'll have storage optimized instances. They're great when you are accessing a lot of data sets on the local storage. And so the use cases for storage optimized instances are going to be high-frequency online transactional processing, so OLTP systems. Relational and NoSQL databases. And we'll see those in details. When we get to the database sections. Cache for in-memory databases, for example, Reddit's data warehousing application distributed file systems and the search optimized instances in AWS will start with an I, a G, or H one. Okay. But again, don't have to remember this. I'm just giving you examples. So what does it mean? Let's compare a few instance types. So for example, for t2.micro we have one VCPU and one memory, one gigabytes of memory. And if you look for example, at r5.16xlarge we have 16 VCPU and 512 gigabytes of memory. So we can see there's a lot of more emphasis on the memory. If we compare it to example, to a c5d.4Xlarge we can see we have 16 VCPU and 32 gigabytes of memory. So less memory, more CPU and so on different network performance different EBS bandwidth and so on. So just to give you a point of comparison, and because we're using t2.micro in this course it is part of the AWS feature. So we get up to 750 hours per month of t2.micro. And if you want a website to compare all the EC2 Institute instances together, there's one that I really like, it's called instituteinstance.info, and I'll show it to you right now. So I am on the instituteinstances.info website and as we can see, we have a list of all the instances available in AWS. So really, a lot. We also get some information around the Linux on demand cost and an X reserves cost, and so on, so some cost information. We get information around the memory the number of VCPU. We can order by name, we can search it. So it's, it's quite handy. And I really like this website. And if you go and use AWS you probably will use this website as well. So that's it for this lecture. I hope you liked it. And I will see you in the next lecture.
