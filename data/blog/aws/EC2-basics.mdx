## **What is Amazon EC2?**

EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS offering. It is definitely used everywhere. And what is it? Well, it stands for **Elastic Compute Cloud** and this is the way to do Infrastructure as a Service on AWS. So EC2 is not just one service. It's composed of many things at a high level.
- You can rent virtual machines on EC2, they're called EC2 instances. 
- You can store data on virtual drives or EBS volumes. 
- You can distribute load across machines, Elastic Load Balancer. 
- You can scale services using an auto-scaling group or AS

## **EC2 sizing & configuration options**
You can configure many things which choosing EC2 such as,

- Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows, Mac OS 
- How much compute power and cores you want (CPU) 
- How much random access memory or RAM you want
- How much storage space,
    - Network-attached (EBS or EFS)
    - Hardware-attached (EC2 instance store)
- Network card
- Firewall rules: Security group
- Bootstrap script (configure the instance at first launch): EC2 User Data

## **EC2 User Data**

It is possible to bootstrap our instances using the EC2 User Data script. 

**What does bootstrapping mean?** 

Well, bootstrapping means launching commands when the machine starts. So, whatever(script) you write in user data that script is only run once and when it first starts, and then will never be run again. So the EC2 User Data has a very specific purpose. It is to automate boot tasks, hence the name bootstrapping. 

**What tasks do you want to automate?** 

EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
- Install updates
- Install software
- Download common files from the Internet

So it could be whatever you want, but just know that the more you add into your User Data script, the more your instant has to do at boot time. EC2 User Data scripts runs with a root user. 

 ## **What type of instances do we get for EC2?** 
 
There are hundreds and hundreds of EC2 instance types, but, here are five for you. So the first one is a t2 micro, very very simple. It has one vCPU, one gigabyte of memory. The storage is only for EBS, and it has a low to moderate network performance. But as soon as you increase the instance type like for example if you stay in the same family, so we stay in the t2 family but we go to t2.xlarge, now we have access to four vCPU 16 megabytes of RAM, gigabytes of RAM, sorry, and network performance of moderate. If we go to complete different new levels, so c5d.4xlarge, which is a very complicated name, you get 16 vCPU, so 16 cores, you get 32 gigabytes of memory, so a lot more, you get some storage that is attached to your EC2 instance, this is where it says 400 NVMe SSD. Now the network is going to get really good up to 10 gigabytes, as well as the bandwidth to talk to network storage. And so, as you can see, if you go to r5.16xlarge or m5.8xlarge, again you have different characteristics.

### **Type of Instances**

There are many different types of EC2 instances that you can use for different use cases and they have different types of optimization. In official [AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/), as we can see, we have different types of instances. We have general purpose, compute, optimized, memory optimize and so on. And so for each type of instance we have different families. Here is the high-level overview of how there naming work in AWS. 

AWS will have the following naming convention:

### <p style={{textAlign: "center"}}><span style={{color:"blue"}}>m</span><span style={{color:"orange"}}>5</span><span>.</span><span style={{color:"green"}}>2xlarge</span></p>

For example, we'll be talking about an M 5 dot 2 X large type of instance. What does that mean? Well, M is going to be called the `Instance Class`. And this is going to be, for example, in this case a **General Purpose** type of instance, 5 is `generation` of the instance. So as AWS improves the hardware over time if we release a new generation of hardware, and so after M 5, if they improve the M type of instance class then we'll go to M6 and then finally the 2 X large represented the `size` within the instance class. So, it starts as small and then large and then 2Xlarge 4Xlarge and so on. So it represents the size of the instance, and the more the size, the more the memory the more the CPU is going to have on your instance. 

Here are few different types of instance types. 

- **General Purpose:** These are great for diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories. They will have a good balance between compute, memory, networking. 
- **Compute Optimized:** These are instances are great, and optimized for compute intensive tasks. So what requires a high level of processor? Well, for example, 
- it could be if you're batch processing some data 
- if you're doing media transcoding if you need a high-performance web servers 
- if you're doing high performance, computing is called HPC 
- If you're doing machine learning or 
- if you have a dedicated gaming server. 

So all these things are tasks that require a very good CPU very good compute side. And so Ec2, instances do have this kind of particularity and for now all the computer optimized instances in EC2, are of the C names. So C5, C6, and so on.
- **Memory Optimized:** They are going to be have a really fast performance for the type of workloads that will process large datasets in memory(RAM). And so the use cases are this is going to be high performance for relational or non-relational databases are mostly going to be in memory databases, distributed web-scale cache store. So for our elastic cache, for example in memory databases that are optimized for business intelligence or BI. And applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data. So in terms of the names for the memory optimized instances there's going to be the R series because R stands for RAM but there's also going to be X one high memory and Z one.
- **Storage Optimized:** They're great when you are accessing a lot of data sets on the local storage. And so the use cases for storage optimized instances are going to be high-frequency online transactional processing, so OLTP systems. Relational and NoSQL databases. Cache for in-memory databases, for example, Reddit's data warehousing application distributed file systems and the search optimized instances in AWS will start with an I, a G, or H one. 

Let's compare a few instance types. So for example as you seen picture above, for t2.micro we have one VCPU and one memory, one gigabytes of memory. And if you look for example, at r5.16xlarge we have 16 VCPU and 512 gigabytes of memory. So we can see there's a lot of more emphasis on the memory. If we compare it to example, to a c5d.4Xlarge we can see we have 16 VCPU and 32 gigabytes of memory. So less memory, more CPU and so on different network performance different EBS bandwidth and so on. 

You can see all the EC2 instances comparision in a website called [instances.vantage.sh](https://www.instances.vantage.sh)

 ## **EC2 instance purchasing options** 

1. **On-demand instances:** They allow us to run instances on demands, that means they're good for short workloads, we get predictable pricing, and we're going to pay by the second. 
    - Pay for what you use:
        - Linux or Windows - billing per second, after the first minute
        - All other OS - billing per hour
    - Has heighest cost but no upfront payment
    - No long-term commitments
    - Recommended for a short-term and uninterrupted workload where you cannot predict how the application will behave. 

2. **Reserved:**

    **Reserved instances:** You have one year or three years term, and they're meant for long workloads. So if you know you're going to run a database for a long time, then a reserved instance is great. 
        - Up to 72% discount comparison to On-demand instances
        - You reserve a specific instance attributes (Instance Type, Region, Tenancy, OS)
        - You specify a reservation period one year(discount+) or three years(discount+++), to get even more discounts
        - Payment options: No upfront(discount+), Partial upfront(discount++), All upfront(discount+++)
        - Reserved instance's scope: Regional or Zonal (reserve capacity in an AZ)
        - You would use reserved instances for the steady-state usage applications(like database)
        - You can buy or sell your reserved instances in a marketplace if you don't need them anymore

    **Convertible reserved instances:** It allows you to change the instance type, the instance family, the operating system, the scope and the tenancy.
        - Because you have more flexibility, well you get a bit less discounts you get up to 66% discounts
    
3. **Savings plan:** Savings plan are one and three years term, and they're more modern because instead of committing to a specific instance type, you commit to a specific amount of usage in dollars, and there again, for long workloads. 
    - It is to allow you to get a discount based on long-term usage(upto 72% - same as RIs)
    - Commit to certain type of usage (I want to spend $10 per hour for the next 1, 2, 3 year)
    - Usage beyond the savings plan is going to be billed at the on-demand price
    - Locked to a specific instance family and region (e.g. M5 in us-east-1)
    - flexible across:
        - Instance size(e.g., e5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge)
        - OS (Linux, Windows)
        - Tenancy (Host, Dedicated, Default)

4. **Spot instances:** They are meant for very short workloads, they're very, very cheap, but at any time you can lose these instances and that makes them less reliable. 
    - Can get discount upto 90% compared to On-demand
    - They are instances you can lose at any point of time because you define a max price you're willing to pay for your spot instances. And if the spot price goes over it, then you're going to lose it.
    - The MOST cost-effective instance in AWS
    - Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure    
        - Batch jobs
        - Data analysis
        - Image processing
        - Any distributed workloads
        - Workloads with a flexible state and end time
    - Not suitable for critical jobs or database

5. **Dedicated host:** It allows you to book an entire physical server and control instance placements. 
    - A physical server with Ec2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use.
    - You want to have dedicated hosts in the use case of, you have compliance requirements or you need to use your existing server-bound software licenses that has billing based on a per-socket, per-core, per VM software licenses. This is in these kind of use cases that you need to access the physical server and get a dedicated host.
    - Purchasing Host payment options:
        - On-demand: pay per second for active dedicated-host
        - Reserved: 1 or 3 years
    - The most expensive option of AWS
    - **Usecases:**
        -  When you have a software that comes with a licensing model that is bring your own license
        - if you have a company that has strong regulatory or compliance needs

6. **Dedicated instances:**  In that no other customers will share your hardware
    - Instance run on hardware that's dedicated to you, which is different from the physical server
    - You may share the hardware with other instances in the same accounts and you have no control over instance placements (can move hardware after stop/start)

    > Dedicated instances mean that you have your own instance on your own hardware, whereas dedicated host, you get access to the physical server itself and it gives you visibility into the lower level hardware.

7. **Capacity reservations:** It allow you to reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
    - Can reserve on-demand instances in a specific AZ for any duration
    - YOu always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it- 
    - You have no time commitment so you can reserve capacity or cancel your reservation at any time, no billing account
    -  So if you want to get billing discounts, you need to combine it with regional reserved instances or your savings plan
    - You're charged at the on-demand rates, whether or not you run instances
    - They're very suitable for short-term uninterrupted workloads that need to be in a specific AZ

## **Understand purchasing option through an example of Resort**

We'll take a resort as an analogy.

![EC2 Instance Purchase Option Example - Resort](/static/images/blogs/AWS/EC2-instance-purchase-example--resort.webp)


- The first one is on-demand. So and with on-demand, you have a resort and you come in whenever you like and whenever you like, you pay the full price. 
- For reserved, well, you like to plan ahead and you know you're going to stay a very long time in your resort, one, two, three years, and then you're going to get a good discount because we know you're going to stay long time. 
- Savings plan is saying, "Hey, I know for sure that in my resort I'm going to spend a specific amount. So I'm going to spend maybe $300 per month every month for the next 12 months." And therefore, you may wanna change the room type over time. So king, suite, sea view, and so on. But the savings plan is saying, "Hey, you're to commit to a specific spending in your hotel." 
- Spot instances are whenever the hotel runs very last-minute discounts because they have empty rooms and they wanna attract people. So they get empty rooms and people bid on getting this empty room. And so you get very, very discounts. But in this specific resort, well, you can get kicked out of at any time if someone is willing to pay more for your room than what you did. (But I don't wanna stay in such a resort) 
- Dedicated host is saying, "Hey, I want to book the entire building of the resort." So you get your own hardware, your own resort. 
- And then capacity reservation is saying, "I'm going to book a room, I'm not even sure if I don't stay in, but I know that if I want to stay in, I will have it." And you will pay full price for booking that room nonetheless. In terms of price comparison, I've just put together this table to give you one example at one point of time. 

## **Price Comparison Example - `m4.large - us-east-1`**

![EC2 Instance Purchase Option Comparison](/static/images/blogs/AWS/EC2-instance-pricing-model-comparison.webp)

So I took an m4.large in us-east-1, and the on-demand price is 10 cents, but then the spot price is going to be up to, for example, 61% off in my example. Then if you want to reserve your instance, as you can see, you have different pricing. If you wanted to have for one year, for three years, and pay no upfront or all upfront. Same for the EC2 savings plan we see that it is the same as a reserved instance discounts. We also get reserved convertible instances and we have dedicated host, which is at the on-demand price. The dedicated host reservation which is up to 70% off because you reserve your host. And capacity reservation again at the on-demand price. So the exam will ask you to just know which type of instance is the right one based on your workloads.
