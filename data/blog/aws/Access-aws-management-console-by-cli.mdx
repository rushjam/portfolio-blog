4. Open new CMD in you computer and configure that IAM user by writing `aws configure`. It will ask you to put your access key and secret access key token. Copy both from the AWS management console, which you just created in step 3. It will also ask for default region name and default output format. Write region code nearest to you (e.g. us-west-1), or you can write region name of your choice and skip default output format pressign enter.
